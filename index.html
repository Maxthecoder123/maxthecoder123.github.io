            such as <strong>Python </strong>,<strong> HTML </strong>and <strong>CSS</strong>. 
            Some of my projects were made with a little help but most were made with no
            help at all. I also constructed this website too. Besides from coding
            in my spare time, I love to play on the piano and guitar (both electric,
            acoustic and bass). I have great communication skills and I am very
            flexible when it comes to many things.</p>

        <div class="about-me">
            <p class="text">I'm <strong>Maximilian Misiurski</strong>, a passionate developer with a love for coding in languages like <strong>Python, HTML, and CSS</strong>. I enjoy the challenge of building projects, whether they are solo ventures or ones where I’ve received a bit of guidance along the way. In fact, I’m proud to have constructed this website myself!

                Beyond coding, I'm also a musician. I play the <strong>piano</strong> and <strong>guitar</strong> (electric, acoustic, and bass), and I find music to be a great balance to my coding endeavors. With strong <strong>communication skills</strong> and a high level of <strong>flexibility</strong>, I excel in both collaborative and independent work environments. My ability to adapt quickly to new challenges allows me to continuously grow and expand my skill set.
                
                Whether I’m writing clean code, crafting smooth melodies, or working on creative projects, I'm always striving to learn and improve.</p>
